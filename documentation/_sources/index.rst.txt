Welcome to the REDA documentation!
==================================

REDA is a scientific Python library for reproducible geoelectrical data
analysis. It aims to provide a unified interface for common and advanced data
processing steps while bridging the gap between a multitude of geoelectric
measurement devices and inversion codes used across the geophysical community.
It offers functionality to import, analyze, process, visualize, and export
geoelectrical data with particular emphasis on time-lapse functionality and
reproducibility. The latter is realized in the form of a logging system, which
keeps track of each individual processing step applied to particular data set
in a human-readable journal. REDA is platform compatible, tested and
open-source under the permissive MIT license. Any contributions from the
community are highly welcome.  Contents:
